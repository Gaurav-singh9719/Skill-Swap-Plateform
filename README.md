🔁 Skill Swap Platform
A Skill Swap Platform is a mini web application that allows users to list their own skills (like programming, painting, cooking, etc.) and request to learn or exchange skills from others. This creates a collaborative, community-driven learning environment.

🧩 Problem Statement
In today's world, many people possess valuable skills but lack access to platforms that help them connect with others to exchange knowledge in a non-monetary, skill-based format. The Skill Swap Platform addresses this gap by:
Features:
Basic info: Name, location (optional), profile photo (optional)
List of skills offered
List of skills wanted
Availability (e.g., weekends, evenings)
User can make their profile public or private.
Users can browse or search others by skill (e.g., “Photoshop” or “Excel”)
Request & Accept Swaps:
○ Accept or reject swap offers
○ Show current and pending swap requests
Ratings or feedback after a swap
The user is also able to delete the swap request if it is not accepted.
